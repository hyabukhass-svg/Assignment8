Implementation Reflection
This project uses React to manage state for the player's choice, computer's choice, and the scoreboard. Components like PlayerThrow, ComputerThrow, ResultDisplay, and ScoreBoard make the app modular. The computer’s choice logic is controlled to ensure it only picks once per round, and buttons are disabled during animation to prevent multiple selections. Overall, this project reinforced working with React hooks, inter-component communication, and state-driven UI updates.
